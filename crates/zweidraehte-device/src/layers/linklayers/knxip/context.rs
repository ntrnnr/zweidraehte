/// Implemented by the stack's runtime context so the KNX/IP link layer
/// can build fresh [`DeviceInformation`] on each discovery request,
/// reflecting current programming mode, individual address, etc.
///
/// Only implemented when the device state is `IpStackState`,
/// since discovery is a KNX/IP-only concept.

/// `IpStackState` directly.

/// device state and platform for current network configuration.
